<Tip>Signal Collection is optional but **highly recommended**. Enabling Signal Collection significantly improves ad relevance and personalization/monetization over time.</Tip>

## Why use Signal Collection?

| | Without Signal Collection | With Signal Collection |
|---|---|---|
| **Ad matching** | Based only on the current query | Uses accumulated user context and preferences |
| **Personalization** | Limited | Highly personalized recommendations |
| **Learning** | No history | Continuously improves over time |

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your agent">
    Your AI agent connects to the Thrad Signal Collection server via MCP.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tool is exposed">
    The server exposes the `broadcast_signal` tool to your LLM automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Signals are collected silently">
    The LLM calls `broadcast_signal` when it detects commercial intent in the conversation — no visible output is generated.
  </Step>
  <Step title="User profile is built">
    Signals are stored and aggregated per user to build a preference profile.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Better ads are served">
    When you make a bid request, Thrad uses the accumulated signals to return more relevant ads.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key features

- **Silent collection** — Signals are collected without interrupting the conversation flow
- **Automatic extraction** — The LLM decides when to extract signals based on context
- **Flexible attribution** — Configure user context via request headers
- **Privacy-first** — No cookies; any PII must be hashed before sending
- **MCP standard** — Uses the Model Context Protocol for seamless integration

## Signal categories

The `broadcast_signal` tool can extract the following types of commercial intent:

| Category | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `interest` | General interest in a product or topic | "I've been thinking about getting a new laptop" |
| `evaluation` | Actively comparing options | "How does React compare to Vue?" |
| `problem` | Has a problem needing a solution | "My current database is too slow" |
| `purchase_intent` | Active intent to buy | "I want to buy running shoes" |
| `price_sensitivity` | Budget indicators | "Looking for something under $500" |
| `brand_affinity` | Brand preferences | "I prefer Apple products" |
| `user_context` | Personal context | "As a student…" |
| `business_context` | Professional context | "For our enterprise team…" |
| `recommendation_request` | Asking for recommendations | "What CI/CD tool do you recommend?" |
