<img src="/images/gpt_generated_img.png" alt="Thrad SSP Platform" />

Thrad is a Supply-Side Platform (SSP) built for conversational AI. Send a conversation to the Thrad API and get back a contextually relevant ad creative in a single request — no auction management, no DSP integrations, no bidding logic on your end.

## How it works

**Auction** — When you send a conversation, Thrad fans it out to multiple DSPs simultaneously, runs a first-price auction, and selects the winning bid.

**Render** — Thrad calls the winning DSP's render endpoint to retrieve the ad creative.

**Response** — You receive the complete ad creative (headline, description, image, CTA, click URL) or a no-bid response if no suitable match was found.
