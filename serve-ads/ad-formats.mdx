## Response structure

Every winning bid returns the same object regardless of which format you choose to render:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "bid": {
      "advertiser": "Nike",
      "headline": "Premium Running Shoes",
      "description": "Lightweight and responsive for marathon training.",
      "cta_text": "Shop Now",
      "url": "https://ssp.thrads.ai/api/v1/dsp/redirect/abc123",
      "image_url": "https://cdn.example.com/nike-shoes.jpg",
      "price": 5.50,
      "bidId": "bid_abc123"
    }
  }
}
```

The `url` field is a Thrads click-tracking URL. Always use it for ad clicks — it handles tracking and redirects to the advertiser's landing page.

## Rendering checklist

- Show the advertiser name and a **Sponsored** label — this is required
- Make the entire ad clickable using the `url` field
- Display `cta_text` as a button or link (fall back to `"Learn More"` if absent)
- Render `image_url` only when present — it is optional
- Distinguish the ad visually from surrounding content (border, background tint, or indentation)
- Handle `bid: null` gracefully — skip rendering, no error state needed
