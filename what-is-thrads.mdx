---

Thrads is a Supply-Side Platform (SSP). As a publisher, you integrate the Thrads API into your AI application. Thrads handles finding advertisers, running auctions, and returning ad creatives — you just send conversations and display what comes back.

## Key concepts

**Publisher** — You. Any developer or company running an AI application that wants to earn revenue by displaying ads.

**DSP (Demand-Side Platform)** — Advertisers or ad networks that bid to show their ads to your users. Thrads manages relationships with multiple DSPs on your behalf.

**Bid request** — The API call you make. You send the conversation history and Thrads orchestrates the auction.

**Ad creative** — What you get back: a headline, description, image, CTA button, and a click-tracking URL ready to render.

**First-price auction** — Thrads sends your conversation to all registered DSPs simultaneously. Each DSP responds with a bid (CPM in dollars). The highest bid wins. The winner's render endpoint is called and the creative is returned to you.

## Auction flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="You send a bid request">
    Your application POSTs the conversation history to `https://ssp.thrads.ai/api/v1/ssp/bid-request`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Thrads fans out to DSPs">
    Thrads sends the conversation to all registered DSPs in parallel. DSPs have 2.0 seconds to respond with a bid.
  </Step>
  <Step title="First-price auction runs">
    The highest bid above the $1.00 CPM floor price wins. If no DSP bids, a no-bid response is returned.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ad creative is rendered">
    Thrads calls the winning DSP's render endpoint (1.5s timeout) to fetch the ad creative.
  </Step>
  <Step title="You receive the creative">
    The full ad creative is returned in the API response. You display it, or skip it gracefully if the bid is null.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Sandbox vs. production

Use `"production": false` during development. In sandbox mode, an ad is always returned so you can test your rendering and integration. In production mode, ads are only served when there's a strong contextual match — you may receive `"bid": null` when no suitable ad exists.

<Warning>
  Never set `production: true` in your test or staging environment. Sandbox requests are free; production requests count toward your revenue reporting.
</Warning>

## User and conversation identifiers

Thrads uses two identifiers to improve ad relevance over time:

- **`userId`** — An anonymous UUID stored in `localStorage`. Never use PII (email, name, phone). Generate once per user and persist it.
- **`chatId`** — A unique ID per conversation stored in `sessionStorage`. Reset when the user starts a new chat.

These identifiers are not required for ad serving, but improve targeting accuracy.

## Authentication

All requests require your API key in the request header:

```
thrad-api-key: your-api-key
```

For browser-based integrations, your domain must also be registered for CORS support. Contact [contact@thrads.ai](mailto:contact@thrads.ai) to register your domains.
